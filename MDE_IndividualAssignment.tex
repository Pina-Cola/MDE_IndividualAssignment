	\section{Effects of digitalization} \label{sec:EffectsOfDigitalization}
	
	%Use the concepts of scale, scope, and speed to explain how business and organizing conditions are changing for companies as their environments are increasingly digitalized.
	
	The digitalization of business and organization has a big impact on companies, reshaping the way they operate and compete. These changes can be analyzed through the lens of \textit{Scale}, \textit{Scope} and \textit{Speed}. 
	
	\begin{CountingDefinition}[Definitions]{def:defdef}
		
		\begin{tabular}{lp{13.5cm}}
			
			\textbf{Scale} & describes the rate at which products are created.~\cite{scalescopespeedslides, digitalmatrix} \\
			\textbf{Scope} & describes the investment in customer relationships or physical distribution.~\cite{scalescopespeedslides, digitalmatrix} \\
			\textbf{Speed} & describes the pace in which existing capabilities are improved and new capabilities are developed.~\cite{scalescopespeedslides, digitalmatrix} \\
			
		\end{tabular}
	
				
	\end{CountingDefinition}


	\textit{Scale}, \textit{Scope} and \textit{Speed} are also referred to as the three dimensions of digital business.~\cite{scalescopespeedslides, digitalmatrix}









%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Scale} \label{subsec:Scale}
 
\vspace*{1.3em}
\begin{CountingDefinition}[Scale]{def:scale}
	Scale refers to the size and reach of an organization, for example the rate at which products are created. \cite{scalescopespeedslides, digitalmatrix}
\end{CountingDefinition}


Companies extended their \textit{Scale} in the industrial era by increasing sales of products. This was limited by physical attributes such as cost and availability of materials and reaching enough costumers.  \cite{digitalgoods, digitalmatrix, wiwi}


A big aspect of the change of a company's \textit{Scope} in the context of digitalization is the existence of digital goods. Goods can be seperated into the categories of material goods, services and digital goods. Digital goods can easily and cheap be reproduced and distributed. A physical product (material good) has to be produced more often, which generates more costs for material, transport, logistics and production in general. A digital product can often be reproduced and distributed on a bigger scale easily, after the product was created once. Only maintenance aspects like potential server costs can increase -- the initial development costs of the product will not change. \cite{digitalgoods, wiwi}


Digitalization enables companies to reach a global market without a material good.
But digital goods introduce new challenges like a high rate of piracy, because the digital goods can easily be reproduced and distributed by the consumer, too. \cite{digitalgoods}






\newpage
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Scope} \label{subsec:Scope}

\begin{CountingDefinition}[Scope]{def:scope}
	Scope describes the investment in customer relationships or	physical distribution. \cite{scalescopespeedslides, digitalmatrix}
\end{CountingDefinition}

As described in Section \ref{subsec:Scale}, companies extended their \textit{Scale} in the industrial era by increasing sales of products. This was limited by physical attributes such as reaching enough costumers or physical distrubution (\textit{Scope}). Digitalization enables companies to reach a global market more easily, because the costs of communication and transportation and distribution were decreased drastically. \cite{digitalgoods, digitalmatrix, wiwi}

Digitalization introduced new opportunities to distribute products - for example the distribution of digital goods. Partnerships between businesses became more important and the relationships to the customer are primarily build online. A website for distribution and online customer support often replace the personal experience of direct communication between a seller and a customer. \cite{digitalgoods, digitalmatrix, wiwi}







%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Speed} \label{subsec:Speed}

\begin{CountingDefinition}[Speed]{def:speed}
	Speed describes the pace in which existing capabilities are improved and new capabilities are developed. \cite{scalescopespeedslides, digitalmatrix}
\end{CountingDefinition}

Digitalization has accelerated the pace of business operations. As already mentioned in Section \ref{subsec:Scale} and \ref{subsec:Scope}, the product development cykles have shortened and become more easy and the existence of digital goods changed the whole market. \cite{ digitalgoods, digitalmatrix}

But with the increase of \textit{Speed} the customer expectations adapted and the expectations for the \textit{Speed} of a company have increased. \cite{wiwi}

	
Overall, digitalization has transformed the business landscape by increasing the potential and rate for \textit{Scale}, expanding the \textit{Scope} of activities, and accelerating the \textit{Speed}. Companies are trying to adapt to these changes by continuously monitoring and adjusting their strategies to suceed in the digital era. Failure to do so can leave them at a disadvantage, because the customer expectations are constantly growing. \cite{digitalmatrix, leadingdigital, wiwi}

	\section{Fast-movers} \label{sec:FastMovers}
	
	%Explain the concept of "fast movers" and use the concept of the nexus of scale, scope and speed to explain how organizations can become fast movers.
	
	Fast movers have the ability to recognize opportunities and respond to challenges rapidly.~\cite{fastmovers, digitalmatrix}

	\begin{CountingDefinition}[Fast-mover]{def:fastmovers}
		Fast-movers refers to companies or organizations that can adapt quickly to changes in their environment, for example market shifts, technological developments or competitive pressures. \cite{fastmovers, digitalmatrix}
	\end{CountingDefinition}

	The concepts of \textit{Scale}, \textit{Scope} and \textit{Speed} can be used to explain how organizations become fast-movers. Those concepts were explained in Section \ref{sec:EffectsOfDigitalization}.
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{\textbf{Scale}} refers to factors like the market share or production capacity. A company that is a fast-mover has to scale to their advantage in consideration of the current market situation. A significant presence in their field will lead to more capital and more attention, which can for example lead to better educated workers or other opportunities. \cite{fastmovers, digitalmatrix}
		
		
		
		\item \textit{\textbf{Scope}}  describes the range of activities and markets in which a company is involved. A broad \textit{Scope} is allowing diversity and reducing risks and can also lead to access to a wider variety of customers, which can be an advantage when the company quickly adapts to changes. \cite{fastmovers, digitalmatrix}
		
		
	\end{itemize}

	Speed is the most crucial element in becoming a fast mover, because of the importance of quick adaption to changes, dynamic organization structures and previously described adjustments of \textit{Scale} and \textit{Scope}. \cite{fastmovers, digitalmatrix}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{\textbf{Speed}} describes the ability to make quick decisions and execute strategies fast, which leads to a quick respond to changes in the market. To be able to have this agility, a company often requires an open mindset towards innovation, short and direct decision making processes and efficiency in execution. \cite{fastmovers, digitalmatrix, wiwi}
		
		
	\end{itemize}

Becoming a fast-mover requires a balance between \textit{Scale}, \textit{Scope}, and \textit{Speed}. Companies that can control these elements can adapt to changing circumstances and new opportunities. This is neccessary to defy the competition in today's dynamic markets.


	% chat GPT
	
	
	
	%Now, how do these elements interact in the nexus of scale, scope, and speed to help organizations become fast movers?
	
	%- **Leveraging Scale and Scope**: Organizations with significant scale and scope can use their resources and market presence to experiment with new ideas, expand into adjacent markets, and diversify their offerings. This diversification provides a buffer against market volatility, and it allows them to take calculated risks.
	
	%- **Speed through Innovation**: To become a fast mover, organizations need to prioritize innovation. They should encourage a culture of creativity, invest in R&D, and develop the ability to quickly prototype and test new ideas. Speed is not just about acting fast but also about acting smartly.
	
	%- **Adaptive Leadership and Decision-Making**: Fast-moving organizations have leaders who are open to change and can make rapid decisions. They often decentralize decision-making to empower teams closer to the front lines, enabling faster responses to market dynamics.
	
	%- **Efficient Execution**: Finally, fast movers excel in executing their strategies efficiently. They have agile processes, supply chain efficiencies, and technology infrastructures that allow them to turn ideas into reality quickly.

	
	
	
	% buch
	%However, scale at speed creates not first-mover advantage but
	%fast-mover advantage, which may currently be limited by your company‚Äôs
	%internal organizational processes and systems, if they cannot recognize and
	%respond to the shifts as quickly as some of the newer companies. Changing
	%scope at speed also reflects fast-mover advantage, where the advantage may
	%lie not necessarily in launching products but in tapping into scarce critical
	%resources such as unique interconnected data, patents, talents, or research
	%and development projects, often executed with others.
	%How well you stack up against not only other incumbents, who themselves
	%are transforming, but also against newer-age companies that are aiming to
	%disrupt and transform your industry may well define your ability to compete and
	%win in the digital realm. Those companies that take maximum advantage of
	%scale, scope, and speed together are able to gain significant advantage in the
	%digital business world. First, with data and analytics and connectivity, you can
	%now extend your footprint beyond your core firm‚Äôs boundaries and tap into
	%extended ecosystems. Second, through sensors, software, and connectivity,
	%you now have the capability to collect data, process information, and learn in
	%ways that would have been difficult if not impossible in the industrial world

% Two books in the course literature present and prescribe ways for organizations to manage digital transformation in useful ways. In order to make informed decisions as a manager of a digital enterprise of how to understand, evaluate, and potentially use different prescriptive statements, concepts, models or frameworks, a manager needs to be able to analyze and understand core assumptions underlying normative suggestions for action. For example, management literature tend to based on certain assumptions regarding who the reader is, what type of organization the person is in, what part of the world the organization operates, and prescribes advice accordingly. Your task is to:

%Identify core assumptions in Venkatraman (2017) and in Westerman et al. (2014).
%Discuss the consequences of these assumptions in terms of how digital transformation and approaches to managing it are portrayed in the two books.
%Use the results of 1 and 2, and your own example of an organization and context, to describe where, when and why the approach of either Venkatraman or Westerman et al, would not be suitable












%Identify core assumptions in Venkatraman (2017) and in Westerman et al. (2014).

To effectively understand and use the literature and recommendations, it is important to critically analyse and understand the core assumptions that underlay their suggestions.
These assumptions might be the reader's position, the nature and market of the organization in question or its geographical context.

\subsection{Top-down approach} \label{subsec:topdown}


In the books, he execution of the digitalization was suggested with a top-down approach.
A top-down leadership approach in digital transformation can present challenges and lead to limitations. 
It often assumes that the employees are synchronized to a certain degree in terms of digital readiness and understanding. In reality, they might have different levels of digital understanding and readiness. In addition to this, top-down approaches can be slow in responding to challenges or changes, which can cause problems in the dynamic markets.
Depending on the culture of the company or the location of the headquarter, a top-down approach might not find acceptance and employees do not feel valued in their opinions.
The books assume a company and market environment, that is ready for digitalization and accepting a top-down approach to execute the changes. \cite{digitalmatrix, leadingdigital}







%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Geographical context} \label{subsec:geo_assumptions}

The geographical context in which a company operates is a critical factor. It has a big influence on the company's culture, employees, business environment, and technological infrastructure. 

To assess the pre assumptions that were made by the authors, the companies that were mentioned as an example were extracted and analysed. This extraction did not aim for completeness regarding finding every single example but there are enough data points to draw conclusions with, because most of the example companies are included. The extracted example companies and according headquater positions and industries are listed in Appendice \ref{a:LD} and \ref{b:DM}.

In \textit{Leading digital}, 14 of the 33 examined example companies have their headquarters in the USA. This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:LD_graph}, too. \cite{leadingdigital}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/LD_graph.png}
	\caption{Headquarters of the example companies in \textit{Leading digital} \cite{leadingdigital}}
	\label{fig:LD_graph}
\end{figure}

In \textit{Digital matrix}, the majority of examined example companies is located in the USA, too. This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:DM_graph}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/MD_graph.png}
	\caption{Headquarters of the example companies in \textit{Digital matrix} \cite{digitalmatrix}}
	\label{fig:DM_graph}
\end{figure}

In the graph in Figure \ref{fig:C_graph}, the distribution of the companies headquarters can be seen clearly, too. The majority of example companies are in the USA.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/combi_graph.png}
	\caption{Headquarters of the example companies in both books \cite{digitalmatrix, leadingdigital}}
	\label{fig:C_graph}
\end{figure}

It has to be mentioned, that not only most companies are from the USA, the majority of countries that are listed are industrial countries. This leads to the conclusion, that the authors base their strategies on their experience with American companies.








%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Market of the companies} \label{subsec:market_assumptions}

The industry in which a company operates  is a critical factor as well. It influences the company's approach, priorities, and potential challenges.

As mentioned already in Section \ref{subsec:geo_assumptions}, the example companies from the literature have been collected and analysed. This can be seen in Appendice \ref{a:LD} and \ref{b:DM}. The following graphs show the industries of the example companies.

In \textit{Leading digital}, the example companies seem to be engaging in different markets. This leads to the assumption, that there were not assumptions regarding the comapnies' industries. The graph can be ssen in Figure \ref{fig:LD_graph_i}.

TODO elaborate more


\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/LD_graph_i.png}
	\caption{Industries of the example companies in \textit{Leading digital} \cite{leadingdigital}}
	\label{fig:LD_graph_i}
\end{figure}

The majority of example companies in \textit{Digital matrix} are engaging in the digital market already. This includes building and selling electric products or selling software solutions. Companies in that field probably have an easier way into digital transformation but it is more crucial for them, too. This can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:DM_graph_i}. \cite{digitalmatrix}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{images/MD_graph_i.png}
	\caption{Industries of the example companies in \textit{Digital matrix} \cite{digitalmatrix}}
	\label{fig:DM_graph_i}
\end{figure}



The following graph (Figure \ref{fig:C_graph_i}) contains the combined industries of the examples of both books. Because the amount of examples per book differs a lot, this graph is not significant but included for completion. \cite{digitalmatrix, leadingdigital}

%Different industries come with distinct dynamics, demands, and competitive landscapes. For instance, the strategies required for a technology startup may greatly differ from those needed in the healthcare or manufacturing sectors. The industry's unique characteristics impact several key aspects:

%1. **Market Positioning**: The industry determines the competitive landscape and where the company stands in it. Understanding the competitive forces is vital for crafting effective digital strategies.

%2. **Regulatory Environment**: Industries often have specific regulatory requirements. Complying with industry-specific regulations is crucial and can significantly influence digital initiatives.

%3. **Customer Expectations**: Customer expectations and behavior vary across industries. Companies need to align their digital efforts with the preferences and needs of their specific customer base.

%4. **Technological Advancements**: Different industries have different rates of technology adoption and innovation. Adapting to the industry's technology landscape is essential.

%5. **Ecosystem Partnerships**: Industries often involve collaboration and partnerships within their ecosystem. A company's digital transformation strategy may need to consider these relationships.

%In essence, the industry backdrop shapes the context in which digital transformation occurs. Recognizing and responding to industry-specific factors is essential for a company to effectively leverage digital technologies and remain competitive.









%Discuss the consequences of these assumptions in terms of how digital transformation and approaches to managing it are portrayed in the two books.

\subsection{Top-down approach} \label{subsec:topdown_consequences}









%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Geographical context} \label{subsec:geoconsequences}

%**Cultural Nuances**: Different regions and countries have distinct cultural norms, values, and attitudes towards technology adoption. Understanding these nuances is vital for tailoring digital strategies that resonate with the local population.

%**Regulatory Environment**: Geographical location impacts the regulatory landscape. Compliance requirements, data protection laws, and industry-specific regulations can vary significantly from one region to another, necessitating localized strategies.

%**Market Dynamics**: The market dynamics in different geographical areas, including factors such as competition, customer behavior, and market saturation, can vary widely. Recognizing these distinctions is key to crafting effective digital transformation plans.

%**Access to Technology**: Availability and accessibility of technology infrastructure can differ based on location. Developing nations might face technology constraints, while developed countries may have advanced infrastructure, impacting the digitalization approach.

%**Economic Factors**: Economic conditions, such as GDP, inflation rates, and income levels, play a pivotal role in shaping digital strategies, especially regarding pricing, affordability, and market positioning.

%**Industrialization**: Whether a country is primarily industrial or service-oriented can influence the digital maturity of its businesses. Industrial nations might face unique challenges and opportunities in their transformation journey.



%In essence, the geographical context of a company, especially the location of its headquarters, introduces a myriad of factors that necessitate region-specific strategies for digital transformation. Ignoring these factors can hinder the effectiveness of digital initiatives. Therefore, the literature exemplifies the imperative need to consider the geographical context as an integral component of the digitalization process.

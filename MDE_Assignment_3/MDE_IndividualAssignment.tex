% Two books in the course literature present and prescribe ways for organizations to manage digital transformation in useful ways. In order to make informed decisions as a manager of a digital enterprise of how to understand, evaluate, and potentially use different prescriptive statements, concepts, models or frameworks, a manager needs to be able to analyze and understand core assumptions underlying normative suggestions for action. For example, management literature tend to based on certain assumptions regarding who the reader is, what type of organization the person is in, what part of the world the organization operates, and prescribes advice accordingly. Your task is to:

%Identify core assumptions in Venkatraman (2017) and in Westerman et al. (2014).
%Discuss the consequences of these assumptions in terms of how digital transformation and approaches to managing it are portrayed in the two books.
%Use the results of 1 and 2, and your own example of an organization and context, to describe where, when and why the approach of either Venkatraman or Westerman et al, would not be suitable












%Identify core assumptions in Venkatraman (2017) and in Westerman et al. (2014).

To effectively understand and use the literature and recommendations, it is important to critically analyse and understand the core assumptions that underlay their suggestions.
These assumptions might be the reader's position, the nature and market of the organization in question or its geographical context. 



%Notes (\textit{Leading digital} \cite{leadingdigital}):

%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Example brands: Nike and Asian Paints and Fashionistas
%	\item results in visible customer interactions and in internal operations, this is visible in the financials: Digital Masters are more profitable than their peers
%	\item digital transformation through strong top-down leadership
%	\item focused on top-down and leadership
%	\item 4 main aspects: shared transformative vision, strong governance, deep engagement and solid technology leadership
%	\item positve examples: Caesars, Codelco, P \& G, Pages Jaunes and Starbucks

\subsection{Top-down approaches} \label{subsec:topdown}

TODO sources

In the books, he execution of the digitalization was suggested with a top-down approach.
A top-down leadership approach in digital transformation can present challenges and lead to limitations. 
It often assumes that the employees are synchronized to a certain degree in terms of digital readiness and understanding. In reality, they might have different levels of digital understanding and readiness. In addition to this, top-down approaches can be slow in responding to challenges or changes, which can cause problems in the dynamic markets.
Depending on the culture of the company or the location of the headquarter, a top-down approach might not find acceptance and employees do not feel valued in their opinions.
The books assume a company and market environment, that is ready for digitalization and accepting a top-down approach to execute the changes.
